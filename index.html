        <h2>Introducing My Site</h2>
        <p>My name is Will, and I am going to be a Web Developer. My earlier days I spent most my time playing video games and goofing around with friends. I learned to appreciate and love coffee and shortly after that, food and beer. I have lived in California my whole life, 50% NorCal and 50% SoCal. Weird isn't it? Long story but very true. I've learned a lot working as a bartender, been through my fair share of bad days but all in all, I'm happy with where I am and who I am. My experiences have made me who I am today and I wouldn't change a single thing!... Who am I kidding, I would.</p>
